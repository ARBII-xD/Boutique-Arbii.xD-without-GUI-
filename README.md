As this the application of OUR BOUTIQUE, which allows multiple users at a time by maintain the record of each user including their HISTORY OF SHOPPING. The user can go through different options as he likes firstly by Login then adding items in the cart or by removing them. As the user go for “CHEAK OUT” the bill is generated. It keeps the ACCOUNT of any user until the ADMIN will delete user’s account.  There are options for ADMIN as well by creating as much account as he likes or removing Unnecessary or Non active accounts. In this code I also used several OOP features including Inheritance, composition , Try and Except , method Over riding which makes the code readable and easy to understand
